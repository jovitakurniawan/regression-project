# EDA and Regression Models for Medical Charges Data in US üè•

## Background

With increasing age and healthcare cost, health insurance is an important consideration when it comes to financial planning. 
Insured individuals pay premium to insurance providers in exchange of medical cost coverage. 

Premium sum is determined by insurance providers by assessing risk of insured individuals using various factors. 
However, risk assessment and premium pricing remains a challenge to insurance providers as there are a lot of factors that may affect individual risk profiles. 


## Objective 
In this project, we are given a dataset of US population medical costs to analyze relationships and trends between variables (like age, dependents, smoking habits, etc) and medical costs. 

By understanding the influence of these factors on medical costs, insurance providers can make better assessment on risk and premium price for their future clients. 

After understanding relationship among variables, we built and tested different regression model to assess best model to predict medical charges.

Detailed analysis can be found in this [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/jovitakurniawan/eda-us-medicalcharges/blob/main/EDA%20into%20Medical%20Charges%20Data%20in%20US.ipynb)


## Findings 

Findings are summarized into a [slideck](https://github.com/jovitakurniawan/eda-us-medicalcharges/blob/main/EDA%20into%20Medical%20Charges%20Data%20in%20US.pdf)  


## Tools  
- Python: panda, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy, scipy


## Future Enhancements 
- Test other hypothesis to make the analysis more all-rounded
- Add more visualizations to present better findings and analysis 
- Optimize coding and practice better clean code in jupyter notebook
